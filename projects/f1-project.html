    <title>Formula 1 Dashboard</title>

    <h2>Groundwork</h2>

    <p>
      Formula 1 is a sport where data is king. Using data collected from the
      cars to squeeze out an extra tenth of a second each lap can mean the
      difference between the top spot of the podium and mising out on any points
      during a race. Thankfully for enthusists like myself, much of that data is
      available to the public. Once I discovered a few free apis that allow you
      to pull the data, I knew I would want to do something to use.
    </p>

    <p>
      This project was pretty basic, but it was fun to dive into a new api and
      learn how to use more of the features of some python packages that I
      already knew.
    </p>

    <h2>Skills Involved</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Api Calls</li>
      <li>Jupyter Notebooks</li>
      <li>Python Packages: Pandas, MatPlotLib, etc.</li>
      <li>Data Vizualization</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Initial Exploration</h2>

    <p>
      Initially I was using the open f1 api, which allowed users to fetch data
      about almost any f1 race using a very simple api call. After figuring out
      how to make calls I decided it might be fun to make an interactive plot to
      explore the data. That led to the first plot.
    </p>

    <img
      src="../media/f1-project/interactive-plot.png"
      alt="Quick and simple graph of f1 driver data"
    />

    <p>
      While not very pretty, this served as a quick vizualization of everything
      that can be done. It can't be seen in the static version, but the plot
      shows the approximate position of the drivers on the track on the right
      side and then a graph of the selected stat in a snapshot of the race.
      Using the interact wrapper I added a dropdown menu to select a stat to
      show and a slider to select a point in the race.
    </p>

    <p>
      While this was interesting, it was definitley a first attempt. While I was
      looking into it more, I discovered another similar api, fastf1, which was
      slightly more integrated into python and pandas usage, fetching objects
      that automatically got parsed into a pandas dataframe, which if you know
      what that means you know is very convienient. Additionally, it was easier
      to fetch just the information necessary for what I needed, which helped
      because sometimes the old api would have timeout issues since the only way
      I understood to get the data I needed also grabbed a lot of unesscessary
      things.
    </p>

    <p>Eventually, this is the result.</p>

    <img
      src="../media/f1-project/race-report.png"
      alt="A graph with 4 plots of driver data"
    />

    <p>
      What's fun about this is because of the way the api handles things, the
      script will generate a race report of the most recent race each time it is
      run.
    </p>

    <p>
      Definitley a simple project, but it was fun to create something that
      connects with a sport I like so much. I can't take total credit of course,
      being it was my first time working with the api I did learn a lot from the
      examples listed on the website for the fastf1 api, but I had a really good
      time building on what was there to make a simple race report of my
      favorite driver.
