		<h1>Groundwork</h1>

		<p>Formula 1 is a sport where data is king. Using data collected from the cars to squeeze out an extra tenth of a second each lap can mean the difference between the top spot of the podium and mising out on any points during a race. Thankfully for enthusists like myself, much of that data is available to the public. Once I discovered a few free apis that allow you to pull the data, I knew I would want to do something to use.</p>

		<p>This project was pretty basic, but it was fun to dive into a new api and learn how to use more of the features of some python packages that I already knew.</p>

		<h1>Skills Involved</h1>
		<ul>
				<li>Api Calls</li>
				<li>Jupyter Notebooks</li>
				<li>Python Packages: Pandas, MatPlotLib, etc.</li>
		</ul>
